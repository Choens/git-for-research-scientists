# Git For Research Scientists

_Eventually_, this repo will hold a series of presentations and
workshops for teaching Version Control and Git to NYS DOH Research
Scientists.

As of today, this repo contains one lonely presentation, an
introduction to Version Control and Git. Think of it as a "What and
Why".

To make it easier for people to access the materials I will keep a
compiled version of all presentations and materials in this repo. I
will tag revisions which denote when I make presentations with these
materials.

COMING SOON: Some Training Material for HOW!

# For New Users

To learn how to use Git, I recommend the documentation that comes with
GitLab and GitHub. Their material is well thought out and comes with
cool pictures:

- http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/
- https://help.github.com/

## Windows Users

To use Git on Windows, I recommend the following two tools. Install in
the order listed:

1. https://msysgit.github.io/
2. http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitextensions/

Note: DOH users can no longer access Sourceforge from within the DOH
firewall. To install on computers on the DOH network, we will have to
work something out with ITS.

## Linux Users

To use Git on Linux, I recommend the default
Git Gui and Git Cola:

- Git Gui (comes with git)
- https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola
- OR just use it via the command-line as intended.
- OR use it via Emacs and magit.

The developers of GitExtensions claim their software runs on Linux via
Mono, but I do not have any experience using it on Linux.

For Ubuntu users, installation is as easy as installing the Git and
Git Cola packages using the default package manager or running the
following bash code.

    sudo apt-get install git git-cola  git-doc git-extras git-gui gitk

I strongly recommend Emacs users to investigate magit.

## OS X Users

To use Git on OS X, I don't have any recommendations.

If anyone has any suggestions for the best way to install Git and a
good Git Gui onto OS X, I am happy to update this README.

If anyone thinks I should list additional tools here, let me
know. Please understand that non-FOSS suggestions are likely to be
rejected. And no, I don't want you to lecture me about the fact I'm
using GH to say this.
