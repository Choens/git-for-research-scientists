# Git For Research Scientists

_Eventually_, this repo will hold a series of presentations and
workshops for teaching Version Control and Git to NYS DOH Research
Scientists.

As of today, this repo contains one lonely presentation, an
introduction to Version Control and Git. Think of it as a "What and
Why".

To make it easier for people to access the materials I will keep a
compiled version of all presentations and materials in this repo.

To learn how to use Git, I recommend the documentation that comes with
GitLab and GitHub:

- http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/
- https://help.github.com/

## Windows Users

For users interested in using Git on Windows, I recommend the
following two tools. Install in the order listed:

1. https://msysgit.github.io/
2. http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitextensions/

Note: DOH users can no longer access Sourceforge from within the DOH
firewall. 

## Linux Users

For users interested in using Git on Linux, I recommend the default
Git Gui and Git Cola:

- Git Gui (comes with git)
- https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola
- OR just use it via the command-line as intended.
- OR use it via Emacs and magit.

According to their documentation, GitExtensions runs on Linux via
Mono, but I do not have any experience using on Linux.

For Ubuntu users, installation is as easy as installing the Git and
Git Cola packages using the default package manager or running the
following bash code.

    sudo apt-get install git git-cola  git-doc git-extras git-gui gitk

I strongly recommend Emacs users to investigate magit.

## OS X Users

For users interested in using Git on OS X, I don't have any
recommendations.

If anyone has any suggestions for the best way to install Git and a
good Git Gui onto OS X, I am happy to update this README.
