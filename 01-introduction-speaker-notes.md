# Outline

- Our discussion today, in 4 parts.
- I introduce two terms, informal versus formal version control.

- By the end of this presentation, I hope you come to see you are
  already using informal version control.

- All I am advocating for is learning more about and eventually using
  formal version control.

# Dafynitions

- Version Control is an idea. It has many names.
- Git is a tool which helps us operationalize this idea.

- Idea . v . Tool. Very Important.

- Git was developed by Linux Torvalds, the creator of the Linux Kernel
  to help him manage Linux kernel development. Linux is the kernel
  that powers everything from 95% of the world's super computers to
  every single Android phone on the Market.
- The kernel contains millions of lines of code. Thousands of people
  participate in the development of the kernel every year. Git was
  develop by Linus to help him manage this complexity.
- Since its creation in 2005, it has become the most popular version
  control system in the world.
- The differences between Git and Gitlab are simple. Git is software
  you run on your computer. GitLab is some collaborative server
  software that runs on the Web (internally). This of it as the
  difference between Word (your computer) and Sharepoint (the web).
- Git and GitLab are used by small research communities like:  
    - NASA
    - SpaceX
    - IBM
    - CERN
    
# Git and R:

- GitHub is like the Facebook of programming.
- Everyone has code on GitHub.
- Git and GitHub are VERY popular in the R community. But you don't
  have to use R to use Git.
- Everyone can use Git.

# Once I Shutup:

- Anyone smart enough to earn an epidemiology degree or biostatistics
  degree can teach themselves how to use Git.
- I don't have time to teach you how to use Git, but I can leave you a
  link or two.
- All I can do today is introduce you to some ideas.
- The URL to this presentation, on GitHub, contains all of these
  links. All you really need is this last URL.
- Demonstrate

# When Version Control Matters

- This is from PhD comics.
- Here, the professor and a grad student trade numerous copies of a
  file, orignially called Final.doc.
- The file name doesn't work out so well.

Version Control is only relevant if:
- You collaborate with others.
- You develop complex algorithms to do something.
- You want to know when your code changes.
- Who changed.
- and Why.

# Informal Version Control: Examples

- Many informal means of version control.
- Most of you are already using some form of version control.
- Congrats.
- I use a service similar to Dropbox called SpiderOak that has better
  security and encryption.
- These are not bad tools, but they don't scale well with
  complexity.
- SpiderOAk works well for backing up my photo collection.
- Pictures are static. Code isn't.

# Informal Version Control: Fail

- For most of you, Version Control probably looks like this.

- Which SAS file do you think generated the really important graph
  given to the Medicaid Director last year?

- Welcome to informal version control.
- Easy to start. Hard to manage.


# Informal Version Control: FAILS

- Does any of this sound familiar?

# Formal Version Control: The Answer

- Read the slide.
- Let's turn those fails into Wins.
- Let's look at some examples.

# Formal Version Control: Wikipedia Example

- Most of us don't get to pull an Einstein and rewrite an entire field
  in one work.
- Most of our work is the end result of lots of small advancements.
- LOTS of small changes made over time.
- Kinda like an Encyclopedia.
- Many revisions. Lots of opinions.
- Wikipedia has a formal system to track all changes.

- Demo
- The history of every topic is a matter of public record.

- Imagine what we could do if we had this same level of historical
  detail for science. . . . . because we can.

# Formal Version Control: WINS

- Let's turn these fails from earlier into wins.
