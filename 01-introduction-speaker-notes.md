# Outline

- Today's discussion, in 4 parts.
- Two terms, informal versus formal version control.

- You are already using informal version control.

- This is a practice. It is something you learn.

- I believe science is fundamentally about communication.
- Our products, white papers, journal articles, policy briefs are how
  we communicate with _others_.
- Won't directly help you communicate with OHIP, the Governor's office
  or the NY Times.
- But they will help you communicate with each other.

# Dafynitions

- Version Control is an idea.
- Git is a tool which helps us operationalize this idea.


- Git was developed by Linux Torvalds, the creator of the Linux Kernel
  - To manage kernel dev.
  - Linux powers everything from 95% of the world's super computers to
    every single Android phone on the Market.
  - Millions of lines of code.
  - Thousands of changes per release.
  - Git was developed to help Linus manage this complexity.
- Created in 2005, is now the most popular vc system.
- Differences between Git and Gitlab.
  - Git: software you run on your computer.
  - GitLab: server software that runs on the Web (internally).
  - Example: Word v Sharepoint
   
# Git and R:

- GitHub is like the Facebook of programming.
- Everyone has code on GitHub.
- Git and GitHub are VERY popular in the R community.
- You DO NOT have to use R to use Git.

# After The Show:

- Anyone smart enough to earn an epidemiology degree or biostatistics
  degree can teach themselves how to use Git.
- Today, I can't teach you how to use Git.
- But I can leave you a link or two and introduce some new ideas.

- I want you to think about how we communicate with each other.

- Presentation, on GitHub, contains all of these links
- Demonstrate

# When Version Control Matters

- PhD comics.
- Discuss the picture.
- The file name doesn't work out so well.

Version Control is relevant if:
- You collaborate with others.
- You develop analytic code that changes over time.

# Informal Version Control: Examples

- Many ways: informal version control.
- These are not bad tools, but they don't scale well with
  people and or complexity.

# Informal Version Control: Examples 2

- Discuss

# Informal Version Control: Fail

- For most of you, Version Control probably looks like this.

- Welcome to informal version control.
- Easy to start. Hard to manage.

# Informal Version Control: FAILS

- Does any of this sound familiar?

# Formal Version Control: The Answer

- Formal Version Control is about how we communicate with each other.
- Let's look at some examples.

# Formal Version Control: Wikipedia Example

- Most of us don't get to be Einstein and rewrite an entire field in
  one work.
- Our produces are the end result of lots of small changes over time.
  
- Kinda like an Encyclopedia. REVISIONS!

- Demo: The history of every topic is a matter of public record.

- Just imagine . . . science!

# Formal Version Control: WINS

- Let's turn these fails from earlier into wins.

# Have you or a colleague ever . . . . # 1

- Local copy.
- There are multiple copies of the code base.
- Servers get backed up, but more copies means more security.
- Offers you tools to sync with the remote master.

# Have you or a colleague ever . . . . # 2

- Discuss
- Demo: This is a quarterly feedback report given to the Health Homes.
- The code has changed, gradually, over time.
- I can access the exact code used to produce the reports from
  every single quarter. And that means
- I can reproduce the reports we sent out.
- I can access ANY code state that I commit. ANY.

# This Is A Practive Not a Guarantee

- Git provides you with tools and community norms.
- It cannot protect you from yourself.
- Poor Commits == Poor History.

# Have you or a colleague ever . . . . # 3

- Example: Vertica port, functional code on Oracle.
- Git won't make this fun, but it does make it easier.
- Demo: I don't need spaghetti file-names.

# Have you or a colleague ever . . . . # 4

- There is a lot of code here at DOH.
- In fact, we have lots of copies of code, with small specific
  differences.
- Tracking this is a nightmare.
  - OQPS: Utilization?
  - Code is complicated.
- When there are multiple versions of the code, nobody knows which
  version of the code is the most recent.
  - Nobody knows when the code changed last or what the changes were.
  - Who made those changes and why?
  - How can pull in the latest changes, without affecting the custom
    work you have done to the code?
   
- Branches and repositories.
- Git gives you tools to manage this complexity.
- Health Home CMART report.

# Git + GitLab == Project Management

- Demo Issues
- Demo Collaboration

# What Happens Next?

- I'm putting together some training materials specific to DOH.
- But, the Internet is literally awash with materials on learning Git.
- Google Git and GitHub. The accound is free and what you learn will
  apply to GitLab.
  - Note: Accessing GitHub inside DOH is tricky because of the proxy.
- Google for Git and Science.
  
# Questions
  
- I hope I have shown you some things today that interest you.
- If I have succeeded,  you are re-assessing how we should
  communicate with each other.
- This does not replace any of the tools you are already using.
- It enhances them.
